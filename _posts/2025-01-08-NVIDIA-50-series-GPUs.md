## GeForce RTX 5080

"The GeForce RTX 5080 is up to twice the speed of the GeForce RTX 4080 in games, thanks to the Blackwell architecture and DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation. With new 5th gen Tensor Cores, 4th gen RT Cores, and 16GB of GDDR7 memory providing up to 960 GB/sec of total memory bandwidth (a 34% increase compared to the GeForce RTX 4080’s 717 GB/sec), the GeForce RTX 5080 delivers a massive leap in performance for gamers and creators." NVIDIA claims.

## GeForce RTX 5070 Ti

NVIDIA kept on mentionning, on their website, "2x Faster than the previous generation", This is something that cannot be confirmed yet, still I believe its possible. NVIDIA claims that h the `5070 Ti` is 2X faster than the `4070 Ti`.

## GeForce RTX 5070

Yep you guessed it right, its 2X faster than the `4070`, this rises the excitement for testers to push those cards to their limits.

## Personal Notes

On my side of town, its worth the wait and money, based on the graphs and performs, even price, this is the best GPU launch ever for consumers, just one thing, what does `AMD` Has to offer to compete with THAT.
